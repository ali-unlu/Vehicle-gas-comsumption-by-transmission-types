# Vehicle-gas-consumption-by-transmission-types

# Executive Summary

In this project, I am using the mtcars data set, to study the relationship between a carâ€™s transmission and the number of miles per gallon of gasoline, along with a set of other variables that could affect this relationship.

The analysis comprises of these stages:

Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis

Model selection and Regression Analysis

# Residual Analysis

The analysis is focused on answering two questions:

Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?

Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

# Conclusion: 
Both models support the conclusion that the cars in the data set with manual transmissions have higher miles per gallon (MPG) than those cars in the data set with automatic transmission systems. Manual transmission delivers 2.94 more mpg than automatic transmission (using the multi-variate model). However, other variables (weight and acceleration time) do have significant influence on this correlation and further investigation and multi-variate modelling is recommended.
